# Examples

Here we have some examples of usage of the DEEP agent.

## Simple-App

This is a very basic app that demonstrates the usage of DEEP.

## Run Example

These examples are designed for development testing and need a local version of the agent to be
built.

To build the agent run:

```bash
sdk use java 13.0.2-open
mvn clean package -pl deep --also-make
```
